# MotivAction
## Description
This project was created to be a morning kickstarter. You will be able to get motivational quotes, a to do list, and stay up to date with current news. This project was created with server api's for the quotes as well as the current news list. With this project you can cycle through quotes. We also made the to-do list interactive by letting you sort by priority, and delete items depending on the urgency. We wanted to build something that allowed people to be able to start their mornings fresh and on the right foot.
